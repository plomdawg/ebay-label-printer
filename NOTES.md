# eBay Label Printer - Engineering Notes

These are notes for the engineer for this project. Keep them up to date as you work.

Refer to INSTRUCTIONS.md for the project overview and key components.

## Project Overview
- Automate eBay order fulfillment: detect orders → buy labels → generate packing slips → print
- Single Docker container with Python 3.11+
- Print to CUPS server at 192.168.8.194
- Test-first development with pytest

## Key Components to Build
1. `orders.py` - eBay API order polling
2. `labels.py` - Shipping label buying/refunding  
3. `packing.py` - QR-based packing slip generation
4. `print.py` - Print to CUPS server
5. `config.py` - Configuration management

## Progress Log

### Initial Setup
- [x] Create basic project structure (app/, tests/, etc.)
- [x] Set up requirements.txt with core dependencies
- [x] Create Dockerfile for containerization
- [x] Set up Makefile for common tasks
- [x] Configure GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- [x] Create basic configuration system

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Implement order polling from eBay API
- [ ] Implement shipping label purchase
- [ ] Implement packing slip PDF generation with QR codes
- [ ] Implement CUPS printing functionality
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and logging

### Testing & Quality
- [x] Unit tests for all modules (comprehensive coverage)
- [x] 100% test coverage for labels.py and packing.py
- [x] 86% overall test coverage (51 tests total)
- [ ] Integration tests
- [x] Linting setup
- [x] Mock external dependencies for tests

## Current Engineer Notes
- Started: Test coverage improvement for labels and packing modules
- Focus: Adding comprehensive test suites for complete code coverage
- COMPLETED: Added complete test suite for labels.py module (20 tests)
- COMPLETED: Added complete test suite for packing.py module (18 tests)  
- COMPLETED: Improved overall test coverage from 59% to 86%
- COMPLETED: Both labels.py and packing.py now have 100% test coverage
- Previous Branches: 
  - `feature/initial-project-structure` (merged to main)
  - `feature/containerization` (merged to main) 
- Current Branch: `feature/comprehensive-test-coverage`
- Status: Ready for review - 51 tests passing, test coverage at 86%, linter clean

## Files Created in First PR
- `app/` directory with all core modules (config.py, orders.py, labels.py, packing.py, print.py)
- `tests/` directory with initial test files
- `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies
- `Makefile` with development and build tasks
- `run.py` main entry point
- `setup.py` for package installation
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

## Files Created in Second PR (Containerization)
- `Dockerfile` with multi-stage build and security best practices
- `.dockerignore` to optimize Docker build context
- `.env.example` template with all required environment variables

## Files Created in Third PR (Test Coverage)
- `tests/test_labels.py` with 20 comprehensive tests for label management
- `tests/test_packing.py` with 18 comprehensive tests for packing slip generation
- Improved overall test coverage from 59% to 86%

## Next Steps for Future PRs
1. Implement actual eBay API integration in orders.py
2. Add PDF generation functionality to packing.py (reportlab/WeasyPrint)
3. Add QR code generation functionality to packing.py
4. Add integration tests
5. Implement error handling and logging improvements
6. Add docker-compose.yml for easier local development

## Technical Decisions Made

### Containerization Approach
- **Multi-stage Docker build**: Separate build and production stages for smaller final image
- **Non-root user**: Security best practice - runs as `appuser` instead of root
- **Volume mounting**: `/app/data` volume for persistent state and logs
- **Health checks**: Built-in container health monitoring
- **Python 3.11 slim base**: Balance between size and functionality
- **CUPS client**: Included in production image for printing capabilities
