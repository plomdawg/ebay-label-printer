# eBay Label Printer - Engineering Notes

These are notes for the engineer for this project. Keep them up to date as you work.

Refer to INSTRUCTIONS.md for the project overview and key components.

## Project Overview
- Automate eBay order fulfillment: detect orders → buy labels → generate packing slips → print
- Single Docker container with Python 3.11+
- Print to CUPS server at 192.168.8.194
- Test-first development with pytest

## Key Components to Build
1. `orders.py` - eBay API order polling
2. `labels.py` - Shipping label buying/refunding  
3. `packing.py` - QR-based packing slip generation
4. `print.py` - Print to CUPS server
5. `config.py` - Configuration management

## Progress Log

### Initial Setup
- [x] Create basic project structure (app/, tests/, etc.)
- [x] Set up requirements.txt with core dependencies
- [x] Create Dockerfile for containerization
- [x] Set up Makefile for common tasks
- [x] Configure GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- [x] Create basic configuration system

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Implement order polling from eBay API
- [ ] Implement shipping label purchase
- [ ] Implement packing slip PDF generation with QR codes
- [ ] Implement CUPS printing functionality
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and logging

### Testing & Quality
- [x] Unit tests for all modules (basic structure)
- [ ] Integration tests
- [x] Linting setup
- [x] Mock external dependencies for tests

## Current Engineer Notes
- Started: Containerization implementation 
- Focus: Adding Docker support for easy deployment and testing
- COMPLETED: Basic project structure with placeholder implementations
- COMPLETED: Fixed linter syntax error in print.py
- COMPLETED: Cleaned up Makefile (removed unnecessary targets)
- COMPLETED: Updated README with concise project overview
- COMPLETED: Created multi-stage Dockerfile with security best practices
- COMPLETED: Added .dockerignore for optimized build context
- COMPLETED: Created .env.example template with all required environment variables
- Previous Branch: `feature/initial-project-structure` (merged to main)
- Current Branch: `feature/containerization`
- Status: Ready for review - containerization complete, tests passing, linter clean

## Files Created in First PR
- `app/` directory with all core modules (config.py, orders.py, labels.py, packing.py, print.py)
- `tests/` directory with initial test files
- `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies
- `Makefile` with development and build tasks
- `run.py` main entry point
- `setup.py` for package installation
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

## Files Created in Second PR (Containerization)
- `Dockerfile` with multi-stage build and security best practices
- `.dockerignore` to optimize Docker build context
- `.env.example` template with all required environment variables

## Next Steps for Future PRs
1. Implement actual eBay API integration in orders.py
2. Add PDF generation functionality to packing.py
3. Add integration tests
4. Implement error handling and logging improvements
5. Add docker-compose.yml for easier local development

## Technical Decisions Made

### Containerization Approach
- **Multi-stage Docker build**: Separate build and production stages for smaller final image
- **Non-root user**: Security best practice - runs as `appuser` instead of root
- **Volume mounting**: `/app/data` volume for persistent state and logs
- **Health checks**: Built-in container health monitoring
- **Python 3.11 slim base**: Balance between size and functionality
- **CUPS client**: Included in production image for printing capabilities
