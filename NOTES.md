# eBay Label Printer - Engineering Notes

These are notes for the engineer for this project. Keep them up to date as you work.

Refer to INSTRUCTIONS.md for the project overview and key components.

## Project Overview
- Automate eBay order fulfillment: detect orders â†’ buy labels â†’ generate packing slips â†’ print
- Single Docker container with Python 3.11+
- Print to CUPS server at 192.168.8.194
- Test-first development with pytest

## Key Components to Build
1. `orders.py` - eBay API order polling
2. `labels.py` - Shipping label buying/refunding  
3. `packing.py` - QR-based packing slip generation
4. `print.py` - Print to CUPS server
5. `config.py` - Configuration management

## Progress Log

### Initial Setup
- [x] Create basic project structure (app/, tests/, etc.)
- [x] Set up requirements.txt with core dependencies
- [x] Create Dockerfile for containerization
- [x] Set up Makefile for common tasks
- [x] Configure GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- [x] Create basic configuration system

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Implement order polling from eBay API (waiting on dev account)
- [ ] Implement shipping label purchase 
- [x] **Implement packing slip PDF generation with QR codes** âœ¨
- [ ] Implement CUPS printing functionality
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and logging

### Testing & Quality
- [x] Unit tests for all modules (comprehensive coverage)
- [x] 100% test coverage for labels.py and packing.py
- [x] 85% overall test coverage (51 tests total)
- [ ] Integration tests
- [x] Linting setup
- [x] Mock external dependencies for tests

## Current Engineer Notes
- **MAJOR MILESTONE**: PDF and QR code generation now fully implemented! ðŸŽ‰
- **COMPLETED**: Full PDF generation for packing slips using ReportLab
- **COMPLETED**: QR code generation with base64 encoding using qrcode library  
- **COMPLETED**: Address formatting for shipping labels
- **COMPLETED**: Updated all tests to match new real implementations
- **COMPLETED**: Added docker-compose.yml for easier local development
- Previous Branches: 
  - `feature/initial-project-structure` (merged to main)
  - `feature/containerization` (merged to main) 
  - `feature/comprehensive-test-coverage` (merged to main)
- **Current Branch**: `feature/pdf-qr-generation`
- **Status**: All 51 tests passing, test coverage at 85%, ready for PR submission

## Files Created in First PR
- `app/` directory with all core modules (config.py, orders.py, labels.py, packing.py, print.py)
- `tests/` directory with initial test files
- `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies
- `Makefile` with development and build tasks
- `run.py` main entry point
- `setup.py` for package installation
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

## Files Created in Second PR (Containerization)
- `Dockerfile` with multi-stage build and security best practices
- `.dockerignore` to optimize Docker build context
- `.env.example` template with all required environment variables

## Files Created in Third PR (Test Coverage)
- `tests/test_labels.py` with 20 comprehensive tests for label management
- `tests/test_packing.py` with 18 comprehensive tests for packing slip generation
- Improved overall test coverage from 59% to 86%

## Files Created in Fourth PR (PDF/QR Generation)
- **Enhanced `app/packing.py`** with full PDF generation using ReportLab
- **Enhanced `app/packing.py`** with QR code generation using qrcode library
- **Added `docker-compose.yml`** for easier local development with volumes and environment variables
- **Updated all packing tests** to match new real implementations instead of placeholders

## Next Steps for Future PRs
1. **Priority**: Implement CUPS printing integration in print.py for actual label/packing slip printing
2. Implement actual eBay API integration in orders.py (when dev account is ready)
3. Add integration tests for full order â†’ label â†’ packing â†’ print workflow  
4. Implement error handling and logging improvements
5. Add web dashboard for monitoring order processing status
6. Add email notifications for successful/failed processing

## Technical Decisions Made

### Containerization Approach
- **Multi-stage Docker build**: Separate build and production stages for smaller final image
- **Non-root user**: Security best practice - runs as `appuser` instead of root
- **Volume mounting**: `/app/data` volume for persistent state and logs
- **Health checks**: Built-in container health monitoring
- **Python 3.11 slim base**: Balance between size and functionality
- **CUPS client**: Included in production image for printing capabilities
