4. Add email notifications for successful/failed processing
5. Performance optimization and containerized deployment testing
6. Implement real-time order processing daemon with continuous polling

## Technical Decisions Made

### eBay API Integration Approach
- **Package Choice**: Selected `ebaysdk`
- **Order Polling**: Uses `sell_fulfillment_get_orders` with date filtering to find orders needing fulfillment
- **Label Management**: Implements full workflow: create fulfillment â†’ get label URL â†’ download PDF
- **File Organization**: Labels saved to `data/labels/` directory with order-specific naming
- **API Initialization**: Lazy initialization of API clients with proper validation checking

### Containerization Approach
- **Multi-stage Docker build**: Separate build and production stages for smaller final image
- **Non-root user**: Security best practice - runs as `appuser` instead of root
- **Volume mounting**: `/app/data` volume for persistent state and logs
- **Health checks**: Built-in container health monitoring
- **Python 3.11 slim base**: Balance between size and functionality
- **CUPS client**: Included in production image for printing capabilities
