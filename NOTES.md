# eBay Label Printer - Engineering Notes

These are notes for the engineer for this project. Keep them up to date as you work.

Refer to INSTRUCTIONS.md for the project overview and key components.

## Project Overview
- Automate eBay order fulfillment: detect orders â†’ buy labels â†’ generate packing slips â†’ print

- Test-first development with pytest

## Key Components to Build
1. `orders.py` - eBay API order polling
2. `labels.py` - Shipping label buying/refunding  
3. `packing.py` - Packing slip generation

## Files Created in First PR
- `app/` directory with all core modules (config.py, orders.py, labels.py, packing.py, print.py)
- `tests/` directory with initial test files
- `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies
- `Makefile` with development and build tasks
- `run.py` main entry point
- `setup.py` for package installation
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

## Files Created in Second PR (Containerization)
- `Dockerfile` with multi-stage build and security best practices
- `.dockerignore` to optimize Docker build context
- `.env.example` template with all required environment variables

## Files Created in Third PR (Test Coverage)
- `tests/test_labels.py` with 20 comprehensive tests for label management
- `tests/test_packing.py` with 18 comprehensive tests for packing slip generation
- Improved overall test coverage from 59% to 86%

## Files Created in Fourth PR (PDF Generation)
- **Enhanced `app/packing.py`** with full PDF generation using ReportLab

- **Added `docker-compose.yml`** for easier local development with volumes and environment variables
- **Updated all packing tests** to match new real implementations instead of placeholders

## Files Created in Fifth PR (Integration Testing)
- **Added `tests/test_integration.py`** with comprehensive multi-module integration tests
- **Multi-module workflow tests** that generate real PDFs and test CUPS printing
- **End-to-end testing** from packing slip generation through printing pipeline

## Files Updated in Sixth PR (eBay REST Integration)
- **Updated `requirements.txt`** - Replaced `ebaysdk==2.2.0` with `ebay-rest==1.0.14`
- **Enhanced `app/config.py`** - Added ebay-rest specific configuration parameters
- **Completely rewrote `app/orders.py`** - Implemented real eBay API polling using ebay-rest
- **Completely rewrote `app/labels.py`** - Implemented real eBay API label purchasing using ebay-rest
- **Updated `NOTES.md`** - Documented the major eBay REST API integration milestone

## Next Steps for Future PRs
1. **Priority**: Update test suite to properly mock ebay-rest API calls
2. Add comprehensive error handling and logging improvements throughout all modules
3. Add eBay API authentication token refresh handling
4. Add web dashboard for monitoring order processing status
5. Add email notifications for successful/failed processing
6. Performance optimization and containerized deployment testing

## Technical Decisions Made

### eBay REST API Integration Approach
- **Package Choice**: Selected `ebay-rest==1.0.14` over the older `ebaysdk` for better modern API support
- **Configuration**: Extended Config class to support ebay-rest application/user/site configuration pattern
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive exception handling for both EbayError and general exceptions
- **Order Polling**: Uses `sell_fulfillment_get_orders` with date filtering to find orders needing fulfillment
- **Label Management**: Implements full workflow: create fulfillment â†’ get label URL â†’ download PDF
- **File Organization**: Labels saved to `data/labels/` directory with order-specific naming
- **API Initialization**: Lazy initialization of API clients with proper validation checking

### Containerization Approach
- **Multi-stage Docker build**: Separate build and production stages for smaller final image
- **Non-root user**: Security best practice - runs as `appuser` instead of root
- **Volume mounting**: `/app/data` volume for persistent state and logs
- **Health checks**: Built-in container health monitoring
- **Python 3.11 slim base**: Balance between size and functionality
- **CUPS client**: Included in production image for printing capabilities
