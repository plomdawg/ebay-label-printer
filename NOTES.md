# eBay Label Printer - Engineering Notes

These are notes for the engineer for this project. Keep them up to date as you work.

Refer to INSTRUCTIONS.md for the project overview and key components.

## Project Overview
- Automate eBay order fulfillment: detect orders â†’ buy labels â†’ generate packing slips â†’ print
- Single Docker container with Python 3.11+
- Print to CUPS server at 192.168.8.194
- Test-first development with pytest

## Key Components to Build
1. `orders.py` - eBay API order polling
2. `labels.py` - Shipping label buying/refunding  
3. `packing.py` - QR-based packing slip generation
4. `print.py` - Print to CUPS server
5. `config.py` - Configuration management

## Progress Log

### Initial Setup
- [x] Create basic project structure (app/, tests/, etc.)
- [x] Set up requirements.txt with core dependencies
- [x] Create Dockerfile for containerization
- [x] Set up Makefile for common tasks
- [x] Configure GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- [x] Create basic configuration system

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Implement order polling from eBay API (waiting on dev account)
- [ ] Implement shipping label purchase 
- [x] **Implement packing slip PDF generation with QR codes** âœ¨ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Implement CUPS printing functionality** âœ¨ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Multi-module integration testing** âœ¨ **COMPLETED**
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and logging

### Testing & Quality
- [x] Unit tests for all modules (comprehensive coverage)
- [x] 100% test coverage for labels.py and packing.py
- [x] 83% overall test coverage (56 tests total)
- [x] **Integration tests for multi-module workflows** âœ¨ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Linting setup
- [x] Mock external dependencies for tests

## Current Engineer Notes
- **NEW MILESTONE**: Multi-module integration testing now implemented! ðŸŽ‰
- **COMPLETED**: Integration tests that generate real PDFs and test printing workflow
- **COMPLETED**: End-to-end testing from packing slip generation â†’ CUPS printing
- **COMPLETED**: Multi-document printing tests with proper cleanup
- **COMPLETED**: Error handling tests for failed PDF generation scenarios
- **COMPLETED**: Enhanced test coverage from 82% to 83% (56 total tests)
- Previous Branches: 
  - `feature/initial-project-structure` (merged to main)
  - `feature/containerization` (merged to main) 
  - `feature/comprehensive-test-coverage` (merged to main)
  - `feature/pdf-qr-generation` (merged to main)
- **Current Branch**: `feature/enhanced-cups-printing` (ready for PR)
- **Status**: All tests passing, 10/10 code quality, integration testing fully functional

## Files Created in First PR
- `app/` directory with all core modules (config.py, orders.py, labels.py, packing.py, print.py)
- `tests/` directory with initial test files
- `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies
- `Makefile` with development and build tasks
- `run.py` main entry point
- `setup.py` for package installation
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

## Files Created in Second PR (Containerization)
- `Dockerfile` with multi-stage build and security best practices
- `.dockerignore` to optimize Docker build context
- `.env.example` template with all required environment variables

## Files Created in Third PR (Test Coverage)
- `tests/test_labels.py` with 20 comprehensive tests for label management
- `tests/test_packing.py` with 18 comprehensive tests for packing slip generation
- Improved overall test coverage from 59% to 86%

## Files Created in Fourth PR (PDF/QR Generation)
- **Enhanced `app/packing.py`** with full PDF generation using ReportLab
- **Enhanced `app/packing.py`** with QR code generation using qrcode library
- **Added `docker-compose.yml`** for easier local development with volumes and environment variables
- **Updated all packing tests** to match new real implementations instead of placeholders

## Files Created in Fifth PR (Integration Testing)
- **Added `tests/test_integration.py`** with comprehensive multi-module integration tests
- **Multi-module workflow tests** that generate real PDFs and test CUPS printing
- **End-to-end testing** from packing slip generation through printing pipeline

## Next Steps for Future PRs
1. **Priority**: Implement actual eBay API integration in orders.py (when dev account is ready)
2. Implement shipping label purchase integration with eBay/shipping providers
3. Add comprehensive error handling and logging improvements throughout all modules
4. Add web dashboard for monitoring order processing status
5. Add email notifications for successful/failed processing
6. Performance optimization and containerized deployment testing

## Technical Decisions Made

### Containerization Approach
- **Multi-stage Docker build**: Separate build and production stages for smaller final image
- **Non-root user**: Security best practice - runs as `appuser` instead of root
- **Volume mounting**: `/app/data` volume for persistent state and logs
- **Health checks**: Built-in container health monitoring
- **Python 3.11 slim base**: Balance between size and functionality
- **CUPS client**: Included in production image for printing capabilities
